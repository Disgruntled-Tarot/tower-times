  <div class="mb-5">
    <p class="fs-5">This project was born from a personal journey through grief, survival, and awakening. Like many, I was raised to question the system — but over time, I started to see just how deep the illusions run.</p>
    <p class="fs-5">Tower Times is a space to track what we’re being shown — and what’s possibly unfolding behind the scenes. It doesn’t claim to have all the answers, but it refuses to ignore the patterns.</p>

    <h3 class="text-warning">Using LLMs with Purpose</h3>
    <p class="fs-6">This site was built with the help of large language models. They're not here to replace thinking — just to speed up research, code cleanly, and help bring this project to life. No content is published without human review and intention.</p>
