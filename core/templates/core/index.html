  <h1>The Tower Times</h1>
  <p class="fade-in" style="--delay: 0.3s;">
    I was raised by a father who came from Mexico with nothing but grit and a warning:
    <em>“Don’t rely on the government. They’ll change the rules when it benefits them.”</em>
  </p>
  <p class="fade-in" style="--delay: 0.5s;">
    I believed in hard work—so much that I gave it everything. My time, my health, my relationships.
    I didn’t watch the system collapse. <strong>I lived inside it while it quietly folded around me.</strong>
  </p>
  <p class="fade-in" style="--delay: 0.7s;">
    Loss, debt, burnout, and emotional silence became familiar terrain. But when the system stopped making sense,
    I realized: <strong>it was working exactly as designed—just not for people like me.</strong>
  </p>
  <p class="fade-in" style="--delay: 0.9s;">
    <em>The Tower Times</em> is for anyone waking up in the middle of the storm—still here, still aware,
    and ready to see what lies beyond the illusion.
