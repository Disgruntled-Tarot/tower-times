    I grew up being told not to trust the government, not to believe the news, and to always question what I was shown.  
    Now I’m watching the very people who used to say that—either go silent, disappear, or nod along to a world unraveling.
  </p>
  <p class="fade-in" style="--delay: 0.6s;">
    The signs are there. We scream that the rich are the problem, yet when the pieces start falling, everyone looks the other way.  
    We're distracted. Divided. Entertained to death. And somewhere behind the noise, something deeper is breaking.
  </p>
  <p class="fade-in" style="--delay: 0.8s;">
    I didn’t watch the system collapse. I lived inside it while it quietly folded around me—through burnout, debt, grief, and the illusion of success.
  </p>
  <p class="fade-in" style="--delay: 1s;">
    This project isn’t about fear. It’s about clarity.  
    <strong>The Tower Times</strong> is for anyone waking up mid-collapse—still here, still aware, and ready to look past the veil.
