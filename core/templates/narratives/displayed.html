    </p>
    <p class="text-light">
      According to this version, the United States remains politically stable, the electoral process is intact, and recent economic and geopolitical developments are being addressed through normal democratic processes.

    <h3 class="text-light">Narrative Overview</h3>

    <div class="mt-4">
      <h5 class="text-primary">I. Election Results</h5>
      <p class="text-light">
        The 2024 election was historic, with high voter turnout and a competitive race. Despite initial controversies, all legal challenges have been resolved through proper judicial channels. Trump’s victory is seen as a legitimate expression of voter will.
      </p>

      <h5 class="text-primary">II. Institutional Stability</h5>
      <p class="text-light">
        Federal agencies and the military continue to function under civilian oversight. National security remains intact, and intelligence agencies are focused on ongoing global threats including cyber warfare and misinformation.
      </p>

      <h5 class="text-primary">III. Economic Outlook</h5>
      <p class="text-light">
        Inflation is under gradual control. Interest rates and housing policy are calibrated to balance economic growth with affordability. Tariffs and trade adjustments are part of a strategy to revitalize domestic production.
      </p>

      <h5 class="text-primary">IV. Public Discourse</h5>
      <p class="text-light">
        Social media platforms and mainstream outlets aim to reduce misinformation while supporting a free and open internet. Efforts to curb disinformation are seen as necessary in a post-truth media landscape.
      </p>

      <h5 class="text-primary">V. What To Expect</h5>
      <ul class="text-light">
        <li>Continued focus on national security and international diplomacy</li>
        <li>Rollout of AI governance and ethical frameworks</li>
        <li>Infrastructure investments to stimulate the economy</li>
        <li>Promotion of unity through bipartisan messaging</li>
        <li>Efforts to maintain election integrity and reduce polarization</li>
      </ul>

  <h3 class="text-primary">What You Can Do</h3>
  <p class="text-light">
    Even within the mainstream narrative, it’s clear that **public vigilance and civic action** remain essential. As policies unfold, citizens must remain engaged — not just as spectators, but as advocates for fairness, equity, and accountability.
  </p>

  <ul class="text-light">
    <li><strong>Hold leadership accountable:</strong> Demand honest answers about how current economic policies are impacting working families. Push for transparency around decisions that appear to disproportionately benefit the wealthy.</li>
    <li><strong>Engage with town halls:</strong> Show up, ask questions, and press for real dialogue — not just talking points. Record and share moments where officials are pressed on key issues.</li>
    <li><strong>Organize economic resistance:</strong> Support boycotts or divestment from corporations shown to influence policy at the expense of public well-being. Push for campaign finance reform and anti-monopoly action.</li>
    <li><strong>Promote civic unity, not silence:</strong> Bipartisanship should not be a mask for corporate alignment. Push for collaboration that centers community needs, not elite agendas.</li>
    <li><strong>Vote strategically, not blindly:</strong> Understand who funds your candidates. Track their donors. Support those with consistent, people-first platforms and a history of transparency.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-light mt-3">
    Democracy doesn’t end at the ballot box — it requires constant pressure. The sooner we challenge the quiet erosion of economic fairness, the faster we shift the trajectory away from elite-driven policy paralysis.
